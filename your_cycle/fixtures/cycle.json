Our period.\n Did you know it’s also referred to as menses which actually comes from the latin term ‘mensis’ meaning ‘month’?\n This bleeding phase starts on day one and lasts 3-7 days (although could be less, could be more!).\n Technically it is part of the follicular phase and is often labelled as early follicular phase in research papers.\n Everything is low\n When menstruation starts both oestrogen and progesterone are at their lowest point and they are at the lowest they will be all cycle (progesterone will actually remain low until after ovulation.)\n Low hormone levels means low energy, mood and motivation although by day 3 oestrogen is rising again and testosterone isn’t far behind. Which means that, thankfully, our energy, mood and motivation all begin to rise again.\n What causes menstruation?\n Menstruation occurs because right before our period, progesterone and oestrogen levels both plummet which stimulate the release of prostaglandins (hormone like compounds).\n These then cause the arterioles within the uterus to constrict and as a result this means that oxygen is unable to make its way to the cells.\n Obviously cells that are oxygen depleted, they die. Which cause breakdown and shedding of the lining of the uterus. Hence, your your period.\n It’s also worth noting that the menstrual flow from the uterus isn’t just blood. It also includes tissue fluid, mucus and epithelial cells.\n The ovaries recruit a handful of ovarian follicles
It is also during this phase that the ovaries recruit a handful of ovarian follicles (which are little balloon like sacs that contain a single egg) and encourage them to mature and develop.\n This developmental process may take several months. This means that a follicle that begins to develop at the beginning of a particular menstrual cycle may not reach maturity and ovulate until several menstrual cycles later.\n So this is one reasons why we may have issues with our menstrual cycle that has been caused by stress we were experiencing a few months ago when our follicles were beginning to develop."}}]
